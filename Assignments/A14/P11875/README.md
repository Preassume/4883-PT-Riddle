## 11875 - Brick Game
### Austin Riddle
### Description:

There is a village in Bangladesh, where brick game is very popular. Brick game is a team game. Each
team consists of odd number of players. Number of players must be greater than 1 but cannot be
greater than 10. Age of each player must be within 11 and 20. No two players can have the same age.
There is a captain for each team. The communication gap between two players depends on their age
difference, i.e. the communication gap is larger if the age difference is larger. Hence they select the
captain of a team in such a way so that the number of players in the team who are younger than that
captain is equal to the number of players who are older than that captain.
Ages of all members of the team are provided. You have to determine the age of the captain.

This is a very simple problem where the answer is basically always in the same location in the input.
