This assignment has problems __10226__ (Hardwood Species) and __10194__ (Football aka Soccer.)

My hardwood species code found in ```tree.cpp``` is working great.  I used a ```std::map``` container to keep track of the tree species.  The key is the species name and the value is the number of times that species has occurred.  Something to note is that I used a ```long double``` to keep track of the number of species.  This allowed for a decimal approximation of the percentages of each species to be generated.

I haven't had quite as good luck with the soccer program yet, so it is stil a work in progress.  With all of the test data inputs I have tried, it yields the correct output.  So I'm sure it's close to being correct.
