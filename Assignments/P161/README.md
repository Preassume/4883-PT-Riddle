This is problem __161__ from https://onlinejudge.org/ called __Traffic Lights__.

I opted for a highly organized code structure for this problem, for better or for worse.  Each stage of the problem is encapsulated into its own function.  In addition, each traffic light is represented by a ```light``` structure which handles some simple logic for incrementing the lights and checking if it's green or not.  Perhaps it isn't the fastest way, but it's what jumped out to me.

I think the code could probably be simplified further, but for now, it works.
