## 112 - Tree Summing
### Austin Riddle
### Description:

LISP was one of the earliest high-level programming languages
and, with FORTRAN, is one of the oldest languages currently
being used. Lists, which are the fundamental data structures in
LISP, can easily be adapted to represent other important data
structures such as trees.
This problem deals with determining whether binary trees
represented as LISP S-expressions possess a certain property.
Given a binary tree of integers, you are to write a program
that determines whether there exists a root-to-leaf path whose
nodes sum to a specified integer.

### Instructions

- This project was compiled with GNU GCC 11.1.0.  It should work with any C++11 or newer compiler.
- Simply compile treesum.cpp and run the executable. ```g++ treesum.cpp -o treesum```
- To supply the input file, run it like this: ```./treesum < data.dat```
- To output to a file, run it like this: ```./treesum < data.dat > out.txt``` (out.txt can be anything you want)
